## Day 1

L00_Prerequests

4 groups and installed git, nodejs (java script runtime environment), typescript (JavaScript Syntax extension) 
& VisualStudios (Code editor) and some Extensions vor
VisualStudios like ESLint (code analysis) and Git Graph (displaying Grap

L01.1_Git

registered an account at GitHub and created a personal repository and a [team](https://github.com/MiaGMB/Caffeine-) repository for Code 1
with markdown pages. 

L01.2_Git

What we learned:
- cloning a repository to local computer
- how to push changes from to clone back to github
- How repositorys, commits, branch and remote are connected 
- we learned how to use stage, commit, fetch, pull, push, merge
- how to merge two diffrent brnaches with diffrent changes


L01.3_Git 

What we learned:
- how to exclude a file from being tracked by Git
- how to roll back to the last commit
- how to remove all untracked files from local folder
- diffrent merge strategies like merge rebase and squash

L01.4_Git

Time to answer some questions:
- what is Sync changes? You just sync the changes you made in VS to github
- What does the .git folder do in my project? I guess it connects the markdown page to my github repository
- Why we use github instead of ex. Google Drive? With GitHub you can work on diffrent branches, resulting in diffrent versions of your project and can always merge or roll back to branches you've already overwritten


## Day 2

L02.1_HTML

- What's the meaning of HTML? Hypertext Markup Language
- where does the Markup come from? Elements are marked up using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content
- What is Syntax? Syntax is the "Grammar" of the Code
What is Semantics? Semantics is the vocabulary of the Code

L02.2_HTML
- The browser has to load only the String Content when opening an html file while it also has to load the pre-style of the text when opening a txt file
