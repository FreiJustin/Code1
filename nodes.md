# Code 1
## Day 1

L00_Prerequests

4 groups and installed git, nodejs (java script runtime environment), typescript (JavaScript Syntax extension) 
& VisualStudios (Code editor) and some Extensions vor
VisualStudios like ESLint (code analysis) and Git Graph (displaying Grap

L01.1_Git

registered an account at GitHub and created a personal repository and a [team](https://github.com/MiaGMB/Caffeine-) repository for Code 1
with markdown pages. 

L01.2_Git

What we learned:
- cloning a repository to local computer
- how to push changes from to clone back to github
- How repositorys, commits, branch and remote are connected 
- we learned how to use stage, commit, fetch, pull, push, merge
- how to merge two diffrent brnaches with diffrent changes


L01.3_Git 

What we learned:
- how to exclude a file from being tracked by Git
- how to roll back to the last commit
- how to remove all untracked files from local folder
- diffrent merge strategies like merge rebase and squash

L01.4_Git

Time to answer some questions:
- what is Sync changes? You just sync the changes you made in VS to github
- What does the .git folder do in my project? I guess it connects the markdown page to my github repository
- Why we use github instead of ex. Google Drive? With GitHub you can work on diffrent branches, resulting in diffrent versions of your project and can always merge or roll back to branches you've already overwritten


## Day 2

L02.1_HTML

- What's the meaning of HTML? Hypertext Markup Language
- where does the Markup come from? Elements are marked up using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content
- What is Syntax? Syntax is the "Grammar" of the Code
- What is Semantics? Semantics is the vocabulary of the Code

L02.2_HTML
- The browser has to load only the String Content when opening an html file while it also has to load the pre-style of the text when opening a txt file 
- HTML files are structured like a tree. You have a Head which can contain Objects, and those objects can contain other objects etc. After the head comes the body which contains the most content of the file. It can also contain objects inside objects inside objects etc.

L02.3_HTML

manipulating HTML. Look what I've done!

L02.4_ HTML
- There are multiple tags like: cite (title), q (quotation marks), code (showing a part of the code), ins (custom text)
- this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) says that you can categorise the tags by: basic HTML, Formatting, Forms and Input, Frames, Images, Audio and Video, Links, Lists, Tables, Styles and Semantics, Meta Info, Programming.
- Basic attributes are for example src (pth to images), href (for hyperlinks, it defines a URL), width and height (defines the size of image in pixels), alt (alternate text for an image. If there has been a problem with loading the image, this alternate name will display), lang (language of the web page), title (defines extra information)

L02.5_HTML

- We Activated GitHub Pages which is basically an easy way to make your own webpages with your github repository
- Added links to the Tag demonstration and manipulation html files into a new index html file which will be presented in the github page when clicking on the github pages link.

## Day 3

L02.6_HTML

- we made a branch Story which you can see here 

L03.1_CSS

- Cascading refers to the logic the browser uses to prefer a ruleset when there is a conflict between diffrent rulesets

L03.2_CSS

- you can use CSS to address elements rleative to eachother or the page. You can do that with flex or grid
- Having played the full ame of Flexbox Froggies, I am now a master of flex

L03.3_CSS

- you can use various ways to address elements like with an id or other attributes which you can select in CSS using multiple techniques I learned in CSS-Dine which I have beaten as well.
