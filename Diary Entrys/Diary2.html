        <h3>L02.1_HTML </h3>
        <br>
        - What's the meaning of HTML? Hypertext Markup Language<br>
- where does the Markup come from? Elements are marked up using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content<br>
- What is Syntax? Syntax is the "Grammar" of the Code<br>
- What is Semantics? Semantics is the vocabulary of the Code<br>
        <br>
        <h3>L02.2_HTML</h3>
        <br>
        - The browser has to load only the String Content when opening an html file while it also has to load the pre-style of the text when opening a txt file <br>
- HTML files are structured like a tree. You have a Head which can contain Objects, and those objects can contain other objects etc. After the head comes the body which contains the most content of the file. It can also contain objects inside objects inside objects etc.

        <br>
        - There are multiple tags like: cite (title), q (quotation marks), code (showing a part of the code), ins (custom text) <br>
        - this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp"> Website</a> says that you can categorise the tags by: basic HTML, Formatting, Forms and Input, Frames, Images, Audio and Video, Links, Lists, Tables, Styles and Semantics, Meta Info, Programming.<br>
        - Basic attributes are for example src (pth to images), href (for hyperlinks, it defines a URL), width and height (defines the size of image in pixels), alt (alternate text for an image. If there has been a problem with loading the image, this alternate name will display), lang (language of the web page), title (defines extra information)<br>
        <br>
        <h3>L02.5_HTML</h3>
