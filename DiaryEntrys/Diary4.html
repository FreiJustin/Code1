        <h3>L04.1_JS/TS</h3>
        <br>
        - created and linked a classic "Hello World" script in Java and TS 
        <br>
        <h4>Difference between TS and JS</h4>
        <br>
        - TS is known as an Object-oriented programming Language<br>
        - JS was initially designed as a client-side language. It has its problems when used for more complex Projects<br>
        - TS is basically JS with more extensions and higher orientation on Object-Based Programming
        <br>
        <h4>Why we use TS instead of JS</h4>
        <br>
        TS is basically a better version of JavaScript when working on larger Project like Videogames, which is our main goal when programming.
        When working on Videogames, Object-Oriented Programming is very important which is a huge pro argument for TS
