        <br>
        - what is Sync changes? You just sync the changes you made in VS to github
- What does the .git folder do in my project? I guess it connects the markdown page to my github repository
- Why we use github instead of ex. Google Drive? With GitHub you can work on diffrent branches, resulting in diffrent versions of your project and can always merge or roll back to branches you've already overwritten
